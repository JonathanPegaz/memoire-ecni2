> Cryptomnesia presents us with a strange phenomenon in which we take ourselves to be imagining, but the thought or idea that we entertain actually involves remembered content.

> [...] it is a mnemonic phenomenon that involves imagination.

> In cases of cryptomnesia, one takes oneself to be imagining, but the thought or idea that one entertains actually involves remembered content.

> Cryptomnesia can often result in unconsciousness plagiarism or even self- plagiarism (Skinner, 1983). You remember an image, a song, or an idea that you previously experienced, but you mistake this for something you created or invented. In such cases you appear to be unsuccessfully imagining.

> The world of musical creation, too, is littered with examples of cryptomnesia. One of the most famous legal cases of copyright infringement involved George Harrison, of the Beatles. Harrison’s song, My Sweet Lord, seemed to bear an uncanny resemblance to an earlier song composed by Ronald Mack for the Chiffons, entitled He’s So Fine.

> What matters for cryptomnesia is that one experiences that content as being the result of one’s own creative act

> Episodic memory may frequently be about memories of repeated events (Andonovski, 2020).

> [...] it doesn’t seem to follow from this that the song is entertained as ‘real’, at least not in the sense that it is entertained as being a part of the mind-independent world. This becomes clear when we consider the fact that even after a collection of sentences is entertained as a song during the creative process, the contents of the song are still under the subject’s control

> Thus, if by ‘real’ we mean that the song becomes a part of the mind-independent world, then it is not true that the objects of cryptomnesia are entertained as real.

> On our view, the mental state that a subject enjoys on a given situation is fundamental in determining whether they are remembering, imagining, or in a state of cryptomnesia.

> [...] a subject successfully remembers when they adopt the attitude of remembering towards a retained content and there is no source-monitoring error involved

> A first type is what we call pure creative imaginings: when a subject adopts an attitude of imagining towards a non-retained content and there is no source-error involved. For instance, when a musician composes a completely new song.

> [...] that cryptomnesia is not remembering.
