> Previous work has shown that the presence of examples may lead to cryptomnesia, or inadvertent plagiarism, on creative tasks.

> For instance, novices, with limited knowledge, may be more prone to inadvertently plagiarize examples, and increases in cognitive load may result in an inability to recall the source of an idea.

> Based on principles of schema theory and cognitive load, in order to reduce cryptomnesia it is recommended to avoid providing examples for higher level learning objectives and avoid simultaneous presentation of congruent task modalities.

> Cryptomnesia may result from a failure in sourcemonitoring (Defeldre, 2005) given excess cognitive load (Marsh, Landau, & Hicks, 1997)
