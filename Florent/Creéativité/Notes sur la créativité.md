La notion de créativité a toujours été très difficile à définir clairement.

As early as 1960, Repucci counted between 50 and 60 defi-nitions extant in the literature on creativity. Commenting onthe situation in 1961, Rhodes said that “The profusion [of defi-nitions] was enough to give one the impression that creativityis a province for pseudo-intellectuals” (p. 306) ^d86e63
